# Getting started with Fuel Quota app

## Clone the repo locally
Clone the application by running the following command:
git clone https://github.com/ben123-source/COSC-4353-Project.git

## Build the frontend app

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

## Run the frontend app

Then to run the frontend app, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Setup the MySQL db
Install MySQL on your computer, if you have not done already

Connect to the MySQL db on your computer using any MySQL client, \
I am using MySQLWorkbench client app on mac. You can use the same\
if you like.

Open a Query tab, you shall run the followig scripts in same order:
fuelquotadb_ddl.sql
fuelquotadb_ddl_tables.sql

The above 2 scripts will create the DB schema and create the necessary tables.
The tables script can be further enhanced to add more tables if we create in future.

## Run the backend app
In the project directory, you can run:
### `node server.js`

Once the backend is up and running, please proceed to next section.

## Signup for the user

You can signup for any user you like on the app,\
 when it opens up in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
